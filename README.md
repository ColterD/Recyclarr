This is just a personal backup repo for my Recyclarr config.
It's hard to find configurations out there and even being assisted by chatGPT, this still took considerable time to create.

Free to use, you just need to update the server URL for your instances and the APIs.

The configuration prioritizes x265, AV1, and x264 in that order, to optimize for file size vs quality.
You may need to manually adjust the file sizes but, everything has a fallback option for a worst case scenario.

It's up to date with custom_formats for Trash Guides/Recyclarr as of 10/12/24.  Uses new variables.
